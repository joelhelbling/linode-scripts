# Linode Scripts

Here is a collection of scripts I've written and collected to facilitate the smooth and easy
deploying of linode servers.

## Objectives

On each new Linode, on my first login, I should find...

- Basic security measures configured ([Initial Server Setup](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04))
- a defined sudoer user installed [DONE]
- a defined github user's `authorized_keys` file is installed
- my dotfiles and vim configured
- ssh via root is disabled
- ssh via password is disabled
